# floor-title-generator
A Processing game for generating floor patterns. 

In order to run this sketch, you must have downloaded Processing on your local computer. You must have the jpgs in the same directory as the pde sketch. 

Once the sketch is run, you will be shown a randomly generated grid of floor tiles. Clicking on one will randomly generate a new tile. Pressing the enter key will cover the entire screen with one of the tile patterns.
